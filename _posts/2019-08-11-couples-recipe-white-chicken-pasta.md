## The Preparation.

> The process will be demonstrated step by step with screen captures so you won't have any trouble following this. The most easiest part of our recipe blogging style is you could simply follow the consecutive images below and get a clear understanding of what is being done. **Off we go**.

### 1. Make the Pasta Ready.

Unwrap the Fusilli from the pack and keep it aside. Light your gas stove (set a medium flame) and place the pan over it. Add 3-4 glass cups of water to it and also Add 1 Tbsp (viz 3 teaspoons) of Oil and 1 Tsp of Salt to the water. Wait until you see the bubbles popping up. [This cooking process is to prevent the pasta from being sticked up to the pan]

Now add Pasta to the boiling water. This will take around 10 minutes for the Pasta to get completely cooked. To ensure whether it is cooked, try slitting a single pasta (you should be able do it effortlessly). Make sure it isn't too hard nor too soft.

### 2. Garlic Taste-Maker (Our Signature _Style_) - _Optional*_

This is totally a unique addition to the Chicken Pasta recipe. If you don't prefer Garlic, you could kindly skip this step and move on to Step 3. If you're a Garlic lover, we strongly recommend you to prepare this taste-maker addition. You won't regret it.

All you have to do is chop the Garlic pieces into fine slices. Place a small pan on the gas stove with a (medium flame) and Add 2 Tsp of Oil to the pan. After two minutes, add the chopped Garlic to the pan and keep frying until they become "Golden Brown" and "Crispy".
