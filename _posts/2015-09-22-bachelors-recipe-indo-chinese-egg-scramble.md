## The Preparation.

> The process will be demonstrated step by step with screen captures so you won't have any trouble following this. **Off we go**.

### 1. Turn on the gas burner.

Turn the gas knob on to release the gas, use the lighter to hover over the gas stove and click to ignite the gas burner. If you have an automated gas burner that gets ignited by a twist of a knob then you are a one lucky **beep**.

### 2. Add Oil to the Pan and place it on the burner.

Add the 45ml of Refined/Olive Oil to the pan. Place the pan on the gas stove to heat it up.

### 3. Finely chop the capsicum and green chilly.

> <font color='red'><b>Keep in mind that the pan is heating up. Don't take too much time in chopping. <br>Estimated time to chop < 1.5 minutes.</b></font>

Get your cutting board and knife ready. Chop the capsicum and the green chilly into very fine pieces and keep it aside on your cutting board.

> **HINT:** If you notice a mild smoke or bubbles popping on the pan, you are almost ready to proceed to the next step. If not, wait a bit.


### 4. Add the chopped green chilly and capsicum to the pan.

Use your spatula to push the chopped green chilly and capsicum from the cutting board (don't use hands, as green chillies are rumoured to burn like hell if it makes contact with the skin) to the heated oil pan. Mix it for a while till they become pale. (Estimated time = 1 minute)

### 5. Add the 3 eggs to the mixture.

Break the eggs (**Hint:** I used the lighter to tap break the egg shells) and add them to the mixture in the pan. Keep whisking it for a while with the spatula.

After 2 minutes of whisking, they should look like the below image capture. If so, you are ready to move on to the next step.

### 6. Add Soya Sauce and Chilli Sauce + Salt to Taste

We have almost reached to the end of recipe. Add 60ml of Soya Sauce and 1.5 teaspoon of Chilli Sauce. Mix them and add a 1/2 teaspoon of salt. (It depends on your taste, you can add even less).
