<p>Back with another crazy movie countdown. It really is upsetting whilst the main protagonist of a movie gets killed, well it’s inevitable and we gotta get over it. As the title depicts <strong><em>shootout</em></strong> , only kills with a <strong>gun(s)</strong> is accounted for. Moreover, the list of movies compiled in here is a bit comprehensive and falls under a <strong><u>ruleset</u></strong> (<em>see below</em>). This post <font color="green"><b>does not contain spoilers</b></font>, just the list of names and it’s précis.</p>

<h3 id="the-ruleset">The Ruleset</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No War Movies. (<em>Hart’s War, Saving Private Ryan, etc.</em>)</li>
  <li>Only Confirmed Deaths. (No judgmental decisions)</li>
  <li>No Animated Movies.</li>
  <li>No Black and White Movies.</li>
  <li>Animals as protagonists does not count.</li>
  <li>No Suicidal Kills.</li>
  <li>No Fantasy or Fairy Tale Movies. (<em>The Crow, Pan’s Labyrinth, etc.</em>)</li>
  <li>No Political Personalities. (<em>Gandhi, etc.</em>)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="0-spoilers--other-than-the-death-of-the-protoganists-the-in-depth-details-involving-the-death-scenes-arent-discussed-on-this-post-as-it-may-spoil-the-thrill-factor"><font color="darkblue">0% SPOILERS</font> : <em>Other than the death of the protoganist(s), the in-depth details involving the death scenes aren’t discussed on this post as it may spoil the thrill factor.</em></h3>
<p><br />
Each flick is rated from the bottom to top (the usual countdown paraphernalia), will contain a very small overview about the film (collected from Internet and some on my own).</p>

<p class="notice"><strong><font color="red">Disclaimer</font>:</strong> Opinions expressed in this article are solely my own and not intended to hurt anybody. This is my own list of compilation. Some may or may not agree with these flicks the way I had rated. There is a separate <strong><em>“Close Contenders”</em></strong> section where you will find the movies you expected wasn’t up. I may have missed some masterpieces in this write-up (<em>Apologies for that</em>). However, I had put my best list in here. Skim through the article and I would love to hear some honest views from movie buffs, critics or anybody who’s been into this genre. <strong>Off to the countdown now.</strong></p>
