<p>Ever wondered what to do with your Old CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) Television? Well, even I had no idea what to do with my 25inch <strong>20</strong> year old CRT TV (till date) and thought of selling it for 400 - 500 bucks which I had purchased for 30,000. Well the twist was no one was ready to buy it. Finally I realized <strong>Old is indeed Gold</strong> when I had it converted to a smart TV using a very simple process.</p>

<h2 id="hey-will-i-be-able-to-convert-any-crt-tv-to-smart-tv">Hey will I be able to convert any CRT TV to Smart TV?</h2>
<p>Hmmm… to give you a gist, mine is a Philips 25PT 4457 25” CRT TV. It has 3-RCA (Radio Corporation of America) Input &amp; One IEC Connector. <strong>Any Old CRT TV with RCA Input can be converted to a Smart TV</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="rca-input-whats-that">RCA Input? What’s that?</h2>
<p>Ahem. Check the picture below. Make sure you have that provision on your TV before proceeding with this guide.</p>

<h3 id="google-chromecast">Google Chromecast</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google Chromecast plays a vital role in turning your CRT a Smart TV. We subject Chromecast’s HDMI port as an input to the converter which we will see soon. The device needs a <strong>low power supply</strong>. We are not going to use the power supply adapter that was shipped with Chromecast, instead we will make use of the powerbank’s source.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="3-rca-cable">3-RCA Cable</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is recommended to go for a better quality and durable RCA cable. <strong>Do not compromise on the price</strong>. One end of this cable will be connected to the converter’s RCA slot and the other end of this cable will be connected to TV’s RCA slot.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="hdmi-to-av-converter">HDMI to AV Converter</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are many converters available. MINI was the brand I purchased and I didn’t face any problems with it so far. Once again this converter requires a <strong>low power supply</strong>, in this case we will be using a power bank for the same. The product also comes with a power cable with this device.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="powerbank">Powerbank</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is good to have a <strong>powerbank that can power up two devices</strong> at the same time. As you can see that I am using a Lenovo Powerbank with two slots.</p>
