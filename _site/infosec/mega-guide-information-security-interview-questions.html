<h3 id="1-what-is-a-repudiation-attack">1. What is a Repudiation Attack?</h3>

<p>An attacker can prove a vulnerability exists in an application without actually denying the attack made by him/her. This example can be compared with “Google Hacking”. The attacker would have used Google Dork to find a weakness in the website without directly penetrating it. One more classic example would be the same website may have an information disclosure vulnerability in one of their pages if the error wasn’t handled properly. Repudiation Attacks may also be termed as <strong>“Passive Attacks”</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="2-what-is-a-false-positive-and-a-false-negative">2. What is a False Positive and a False Negative?</h3>

<p><strong>False Positive</strong>: An automated scanner scans a website and it shows the website is prone to some attack (say, SQLi, CSRF, etc), which actually isn’t. <font color="green">The site is safe.</font>
<br /><strong>False Negative</strong>: An automated scanner scans a website and it shows the website is safe from attacks (say, SQLi, CSRF, etc), which actually isn’t. <font color="red">The site isn't safe.</font></p>

<h3 id="3-what-is-the-key-difference-between-penetration-testing-and-vulnerability-assessment">3. What is the key difference between Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Assessment?</h3>

<p><strong>Penetration Testing</strong> is a process of breaking into the system and trying to gain the maximum privilege on the network. The ultimatum here is to get to the deepest level inside a network. This process is more similar to how an intruder would penetrate except there will be no damage caused. The steps has to be properly documented on how the actions were performed to gain the highest privilege.
<br /><strong>Vulnerability Assessment</strong> is a process of listing out all weaknesses in the machine (either by using a tool/manual ways) that is being assessed and list out the vulnerabilities in the highest order of risk. This process stops with this and does not further delve as of Penetration Testing.</p>

<h3 id="4-how-to-define-csrf-attack-in-an-easier-way">4. How to define CSRF attack in an easier way?</h3>

<p><strong>Cross Site Request Forgery</strong> or <strong>CSRF</strong> is a vulnerability in a website that allows an attacker to trick an end-user(victim in this case) into performing malicious operations without their knowledge in the background.</p>

<h3 id="5-which-is-more-important-to-fix-threat-or-vulnerability">5. Which is more important to fix “Threat” or “Vulnerability”?</h3>

<p>Threats can be classified as “Inside Intruder”, “Natural Disasters”, etc whereas Vulnerabilities can be classified as weaknesses such as “SQLi”, “XSS”, “CSRF”, “Non Availability of Bunkers for protection against natural disasters”, etc. A Threat <strong>must</strong> make use a Vulnerability to exploit or create damage to the data. So it is important to fix vulnerabilities first than to focus on threats. Sometimes this can also be counter-intuitive, an insider working for an organization may pass vital information (eg: admin credentials) to an outside intruder. The outsider can directly login to the application with the credentials and can cause damage to the data (in this case, the outsider did not make use of any vulnerability to exploit the application).
<br />Hence, there is no perfect answer that can be provided to the above question.</p>

<h3 id="6-how-do-you-stop-brute-force-attacks">6. How do you stop Brute-Force Attacks?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Adding a <strong>CAPTCHA</strong> functionality to the login forms.</li>
  <li>Enforce account lockout mechanism for a maximum of three to four wrong attempts.</li>
  <li>Fastest fix for a temporary period would be blocking the particular ip address that is making the brute force attempts.</li>
  <li>Authentication Delays.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="7-whats-the-difference-between-an-exploit-and-a-payload">7. What’s the difference between an “Exploit” and a “Payload”?</h3>

<p>An exploit is the medium in which the payload is contained. Both represent a <em>piece of code</em>, but a payload does contain the actual attack whereas an exploit can be termed as a <em>carrier</em>. To make the explanation more clear and precise, take a Gun for an instance. The “Gun” is the exploit whereas the “Bullet” is the actual payload.</p>

<h3 id="8-why-is-encryption-used-for-confidentiality-instead-of-encoding">8. Why is encryption used for confidentiality instead of encoding?</h3>

<p>Encryption and Encoding uses publicly available algorithms. Encoding is not used for confidentiality purposes since the content that has been encoded using algorithms like (Base64, UTF, etc) can be reversed with their available algorithms and there is no secret key involved. In an encryption scheme like an (AES, 3-DES, etc) they have corresponding encryption and decryption algorithms which involves a common secret key.</p>

<h3 id="9-which-type-of-scan-is-performed-by-nmap-through-default-settings">9. Which type of scan is performed by NMAP through default settings?</h3>

<p>Nmap uses a “SYN” scan by default unless we specify anything. -sS will be the default setting for Nmap. SYN scans are faster as they do not create the Three-way-handshake (SYN-&gt;&lt;-SYN-ACK-&gt;ACK). Instead of the ACK, the SYN scan sends an RST packet, thus the connection will be closed and there won’t be any chances for DoS condition. SYN scans were previously called as “Stealth Scans” as the logging devices do not record activities since a three-way-handshake wasn’t established. Nowadays, the devices do record activity of SYN scans too, so it is not fair to call it as a “Stealth Scan” anymore.</p>

<h3 id="10-on-which-port-does-nessus-run">10. On which port does Nessus run?</h3>

<p><strong>8834</strong>. Nessus can be accessed through any browser by accessing https://127.0.0.1:8834.</p>

<h3 id="11how-do-you-differentiate-bind-payloads-and-reverse-payloads">11.How do you differentiate “Bind Payloads” and “Reverse Payloads”?</h3>

<p>Bind Payloads are a piece of code which is sent by the attacker to the target machine. The exploit then runs on the machine as a process on a certain port say 4444 passively. The attacker can connect to this target by establishing connection to this particular port.
<br />Reverse Payloads are also a piece of code that is sent by attacker and in the background the attacker runs another process that keeps listening to the port say 4444., when this exploit is executed, the target machine immediately sends a connection to the attacker machine that is passively listening on the background.</p>

<h3 id="12-what-is-a-promiscuous-mode-and-non-promiscuous-mode-while-capturing-packets-with-a-packet-sniffer">12. What is a “Promiscuous Mode and Non-Promiscuous Mode” while capturing packets with a packet sniffer?</h3>

<p>In a “Promiscuous Mode” whichever packets that reaches the Network Interface Card is compelled to accept eventhough it was not intended for that NIC’s particular MAC address. That’s one of the reason we mostly sniff traffic using this mode. In a “Non-Promiscuous Mode”, the packets are processed only if they are intended for that NIC’s MAC address, others are discarded as it is.</p>

<h3 id="13-what-is-an-open-redirect">13. What is an Open Redirect?</h3>

<p>It resides in one of the OWASP Top 10, this happens in a site which does not properly validate parameters that happens during a redirect. For instance; Consider this URL http://www.example.com/login.aspx?redirect=profile.php. What an attacker does is that he could use this opportunity to redirect the logged in users to his/her site by crafting a URL like this. http://www.example.com/login.aspx?redirect=http://somemaliciouswebsite.com</p>

<h3 id="14-how-would-you-rate-or-rank-a-vulnerability-based-on-your-findings">14. How would you rate or rank a vulnerability based on your findings?</h3>

<p>This depends on how much impact the vulnerability could affect your business. An example can answer this question, During an audit say you discover XSS and SQLi vulnerabilities. Both are equally dangerous, but in our scenario we rank XSS as the first most since the database that has the SQLi is not a production one and it is just holds some sample data. Thus we need to rank a vulnerability based on the risk factor.</p>

<h3 id="15-what-is-an-active-directory-how-does-ldap-differs-from-active-directory">15. What is an Active Directory? How does LDAP differs from Active Directory?</h3>

<p>Active Directory is Microsoft’s implementation of directory service that provides information about the system, user’s activities, policies, etc. LDAP (LightWeight Directory Access Protocol) is a protocol that is used to query the directory services (in this case, the Actual Directory).</p>

<h3 id="16-give-a-simple-difference-between-authorization-and-authentication">16. Give a simple difference between Authorization and Authentication?</h3>

<p>Authorization is a process whereas an Authentication is a method. Authorization takes place during Authentication. This can be made clear with an example, Consider an ATM, You use your card to “authenticate” to that machine and once you have entered the correct pin you are “authorized” to do transactions.</p>

<h3 id="17-can-you-perform-a-simple-mitm-on-a-mobile-phone">17. Can you perform a simple MiTM on a mobile phone?</h3>

<p>Spawn a rogue wireless access point. Wait for the victim to connect to your AP. You can now intercept the communication.</p>

<h3 id="18-when-you-deal-with-a-stream-of-confidential-data-to-be-transferred-across-the-channel-what-would-you-do-first-encrypt-or-compress">18. When you deal with a stream of confidential data to be transferred across the channel, what would you do first. Encrypt or Compress?</h3>

<p>Any compression algorithm will look for certain patterns in the data to perform compression. When the data is encrypted, the compression algorithm will find it hard to compress the data (or it may not compress the data at all). So the good option would be. Compress and then Encrypt.</p>

<h3 id="19-how-do-you-prevent-csrf-attacks">19. How do you prevent CSRF Attacks?</h3>
<p>Use random tokens for each session and transaction. When an end-user logs to that application, let the application create a token for that particular session. That token should be included in every transaction. You can also use CAPTCHAs to prevent CSRF attacks.</p>

<h3 id="20-which-is-better-closed-ports-or-filtered-ports">20. Which is better. Closed ports or Filtered Ports?</h3>
<p>During a scan, closed ports respond to scanners (port scanners like nmap) saying that the service is not running, whereas filtered ports do not respond to scanners. So it is sometimes better to have filtered ports as they increase scanner times by not responding, but it also gives a hint to hackers that a particular service is running on the port but it is being blocked.</p>

<h3 id="21-whats-a-rainbow-table-and-a-rainbow-cracker">21. What’s a Rainbow Table and a Rainbow Cracker?</h3>
<p>Rainbow Tables are pre-computed hashes that was generated using cryptic or one-way hash algorithms. For instance, say we are subjecting a plaintext “secret” to a one-way hash algorithm and 
it generates a hash “eabecfe”. This hash and the corresponding plaintext will be stored in a table. This table is called as the Rainbow Table. It is just a repository that holds hashes that 
were pre-computed and stored.
<br />
Rainbow Cracker makes use of Rainbow Tables to do the cracking process, it is a time-memory tradeoff so the process will be faster.</p>

<h3 id="22-how-do-you-use-netcat-to-listen-and-connect-through-two-different-machinesvms">22. How do you use netcat to listen and connect through two different machines/VMs?</h3>

<p>Say there are two machines A and B, If you want connect to A from B, then start a listener in A by running the command <code class="highlighter-rouge">nc -l -p 2334</code> . Inorder to connect to A from B., execute <code class="highlighter-rouge">nc 
192.168.1.2 2334</code> (where 192.168.1.2 is the IP address for machine A) on machine B.</p>

<h3 id="23-state-some-differences-between-netcat-and-ncat">23. State some differences between Netcat and Ncat.</h3>

<p>Netcat is available in almost all versions of linux. Ncat will replace Netcat in future versions on linux probably. Ncat has SSL support between connections, also supports Proxies and IPv6.</p>

<h3 id="24-contrast-hubs-switches-and-routers">24. Contrast Hubs. Switches and Routers</h3>

<p><strong>Hubs:</strong> Not expensive. Data collision may occur as traffic intended for one machine will reach all the machines in the network. This also results in wastage of bandwidth. This may also 
result in information leak as a packet sniffer can be used to capture packets that was not intended for the particular machine. They operate on the Physical layer as they deal with bits.</p>

<p><strong>Switches:</strong> They are bit expensive compared to Hubs but they are way more smarter. The switch uses a table within to make track of the MAC addresses associated with the computers on the 
network. Switch acts as a hub in the begining (transmits data to all machines when the table is empty) and learns about the addresses and during the next data transfer, the switch refers to 
the table, reads the route (address) and then transfers to the particular target without transmitting throughout the network. They operate of the Data Link layer as they deal with MAC 
addresses.</p>

<p><strong>Routers:</strong> They are expensive than Switches. Ultimately they do Network Address Translation(NAT) which helps you connect to the Internet. They have support for DHCP and it helps in 
automatically configuring ip addresses for multiple machines on the network. They operate on Network layer as they deal with IP addresses.</p>

<h3 id="25-which-protocol-does-dns-use">25. Which protocol does DNS use?</h3>

<p>DNS requests make use of UDP protocol instead of TCP. UDP protocol are unreliable when compared to TCP, but they are faster when compared to TCP. The load factor is very important 
when it comes to DNS, since TCP makes use of a three-way-handshake., it will be a little slower than UDP.</p>

<h3 id="26-state-a-few-steps-you-would-use-to-secure-a-linux-machine">26. State a few steps you would use to secure a Linux machine.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">faillog</code> command to set user account lockouts after certain failure attempts.</li>
  <li>Ensure the linux kernel and software are up to date.</li>
  <li>Never use root account to login, use sudo command whenever necessary.</li>
  <li>Disable unwanted services with high privileges.</li>
  <li>Check for world writeable files and disable it wherever necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="27-if-there-are-a-total-of-65535-tcp-ports-then-how-many-udp-ports-are-available">27. If there are a total of 65535 TCP Ports, then how many UDP Ports are available?</h3>
<p>There are 65535 UDP ports as well.</p>

<h3 id="28-how-to-check-for-click-jacking-and-state-atleast-one-method-to-prevent-it">28. How to check for Click-Jacking and state atleast one method to prevent it?</h3>

<h3 id="70-does-firewall-affects-the-time-required-to-scan-a-target">70. Does Firewall affects the time required to scan a target?</h3>
<p>Obviously. In most cases, the firewalls are configured to drop the unauthorized packet <strong>without</strong> sending “connection refused” message. In this case, the host which is scanning the target 
must have to wait for a minimum time before it knows that the connection will not be succeeded. Hence, this will affect the scanning time of that particular target. There are some smart 
scanners that will tell you to increase timeouts depending on outcome of the scan.</p>

<h3 id="71-how-authentic-is-banner-grabbing-can-you-go-by-the-results">71. How authentic is Banner Grabbing? Can you go by the results?</h3>

<h3 id="77-why-do-you-need-a-host-based-firewall-when-you-already-have-a-network-level-firewall">77. Why do you need a Host Based Firewall when you already have a Network Level Firewall?</h3>
<p>Network perimeter firewalls cannot provide protection for traffic generated inside a trusted network. For this reason, host-based firewalls running on individual computers are needed. 
Host-based firewalls, of which Windows Firewall is an example, protect a host from unauthorized access and attack. In addition to blocking unwanted incoming traffic, you can configure 
Windows Firewall to block specific types of outgoing traffic as well.</p>

<h3 id="78-how-to-respond-to-a-malware-attack-on-a-corporate-network">78. How to respond to a Malware Attack on a corporate network?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Target: In this tool/interface, the information regarding the scanning target is shown. This also includes the vulnerabilities and links discovered.</li>
  <li>Proxy: This acts as a web proxy between the browser (where you configure the proxy settings) and the web application server. Acts as a MiTM interface, that intercepts requests before sending it to the web application.</li>
  <li>Spider: It crawls the web application for links and pages and lists it out in the Target section.</li>
  <li>Scanner: This comes with the professional version of the Burp Suite tool. This is basically a web vulnerability scanner that is used find web related vulnerabilities in any application.</li>
  <li>Intruder: This tool can be highly customizable and can be even used to launch a brute-force attack.</li>
  <li>Repeater: This tool can be used to manually issue a HTTP request and analyze the response.</li>
  <li>Sequencer: The tool analyzes randomness of user session tokens as well as for CSRF tokens. By determining predictable sessions, the analyst will be able to impersonate users.</li>

analysts or anyone who wants to test their information security skills.</p>

<h3 id="81-what-would-happen-if-an-attacker-gets-hold-of-your-website-ssls-private-key">81. What would happen if an attacker gets hold of your website SSL’s private key?</h3>
<p>The attacker would then be able to decrypt communications., there are even chances that the attacker would be able to read the previous SSL sessions by decrypting it using the private key, 
unless forward secrecy is implemented.</p>

<h3 id="82-how-to-implement-forward-secrecy">82. How to implement Forward Secrecy?</h3>
<p>Forward Secrecy can be implemented using the recommended Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm (ECDHE). ECDHE is faster than normal Diffie Hellman. Since the session keys are 
not linked to the server’s key pair, eventhough if the attacker gets hold of the private key, the SSL session cannot be decrypted.</p>

<h3 id="83-can-you-state-any-one-method-to-deface-a-website-without-using-any-tool">83. Can you state any one method to deface a website without using any tool?</h3>
<p>Assuming the website has a stored XSS vulnerability. An attacker can easily inject a javascript with <code class="highlighter-rouge">location.href</code> tag and redirect to any site of his/her choice.</p>

<h3 id="84-given-an-ip-address-how-will-you-determine-the-operating-system-it-is-running">84. Given an IP Address how will you determine the Operating System it is running?</h3>
<p>There is no 100% effectiveness to determine the operating system of a remote machine. However certain tool like <code class="highlighter-rouge">xprobe2</code> is used to guess the operating system to a certain extent. It is 
highly recommended over nmap.</p>

<h3 id="85-what-happens-if-computer-as-nic-card-is-interchanged-to-computer-bs-nic-card-will-the-mac-address-be-the-same">85. What happens if Computer A’s NIC card is interchanged to Computer B’s NIC card? Will the MAC Address be the same?</h3>
<p>No. Since the NICs are interchanged, Computer A will have Computer B’s MAC Address and vice versa. MAC addresses are embedded in NIC cards not in the Motherboards or Microprocessors.</p>

<h3 id="86-on-which-port-does-ping-command-work-and-how-do-you-ping-a-port">86. On which port does ping command work and how do you ping a port?</h3>
<p><strong>Ping</strong> does not work on TCP or UDP, so obviously it does not make use of any port. It uses ICMP. You cannot use ping command to ping a port, instead use Nmap for this purpose. To give a you 
perfect illustration, ping works irrespective of port numbers. <code class="highlighter-rouge">ping sh4.in</code> is same as <code class="highlighter-rouge">ping sh4.in 80</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">ping sh4.in 2873687234</code></p>

<h3 id="87-explain-a-simple-crucial-method-to-mitigate-xss-or-the-cross-site-scripting-attack">87. Explain a simple crucial method to mitigate XSS or the Cross-Site-Scripting attack.</h3>
<p>Input Validation and Output Sanitization are the two important methods to ward off XSS attacks.</p>

<h3 id="88-how-will-you-write-a-good-penetration-test-report">88. How will you write a good penetration test report?</h3>
<p>A penetration test report will be read not just by technical managers but also by business managers whose technical knowledge will be limited or none. The report should have detailed steps 
stating how the analyst/tester made attempts in reaching the highest level of access. It is not neccessary that certain technical steps have to be explained in detail, however the <strong>executive 
summary</strong> should be drafted very well in almost “layman terms”.</p>

<h3 id="89-consider-you-are-going-to-engage-a-security-assessment-with-a-client-list-out-some-questions-that-you-would-ask-them">89. Consider you are going to engage a security assessment with a client, list out some questions that you would ask them.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Make the client understand the difference between Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing, this is where most of the organizations does mistakes. So will this be a VA or PT?</li>
  <li>What is the scope of the assessment, IP ranges, Timeframe, Internal and External scans etc?</li>
  <li>Will there be a Social Engineering assessment involved like Phishing, Fake calls, etc?</li>
  <li>How the assessment be like? Black Box or White Box, For instance, Will a Network Topology be provided for the devices in the scope of the assessment?</li>
  <li>Should physical security assessments also performed? (This involves the assessing team visiting the client premises, If so the cost involved, what are the devices to be tested, 
surveillance cameras, lockpicking, USB dropping, etc)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="90-state-the-nmap-command-to-scan-a-target-and-output-it-to-an-xml-file-without-host-discovery-and-no-arp-pings-you-have-10-seconds">90. State the nmap command to scan a target and output it to an XML file without host discovery and no arp pings. (You have 10 seconds)</h3>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">nmap -oX out.xml -Pn --disable-arp-ping 127.0.0.1</code></p>

<h3 id="91-whats-the-difference-between-301-and-302-http-status-codes">91. What’s the difference between 301 and 302 HTTP Status Codes?</h3>
<p>They both constitute redirection status codes, However the former is permanent and the latter is temporary.</p>

<h3 id="92-how-will-you-generate-html-scan-reports-from-nmap">92. How will you generate HTML scan reports from NMap?</h3>
<p>As of 2017, NMap does not have the feature of writing the reports to HTML format. It can output the report to XML format and from there it is possible to convert to HTML using XSLT processors.</p>

<h3 id="93-iptables-what-are-they-set-a-rule-to-block-googlecom-and-state-how-effective-it-is">93. IPTables. What are they? Set a rule to block google.com and state how effective it is.</h3>
<p>IPTables is a Firewall Utility for Linux Operating System. You can set rules in it for the accepting, rejecting or dropping incoming, outgoing or forwarding connections. The following below rule sets the website google.com to be blocked. <code class="highlighter-rouge">iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m string --string "google.com" --algo kmp -j DROP</code>. To be straightforward, this is not an effective way to block a website, there are better ways to do it by using certains HTTP Proxies. Any user can bypass this rule by simple typing “google.co.in” or “google.co.uk” to access the website.</p>

<h3 id="94-whats-a-transparent-proxy">94. What’s a Transparent Proxy?</h3>
<p>Transparent Proxy is a type of caching proxy that is configured to sit on the gateway and intercepts the WWW requests from the client and fetches the data for the first time and the consecutive requests are cached. A Transparent Proxy can be clearly understood with these two examples.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You come to some restaurant and you want to access their WiFi Hotspot, Once you get the credentials and you connect to their WWW Gateway, You will be authorized to use the internet. Here all the data what you request and send will be routed through this proxy.</li>
  <li>A Content Delivery Network or a CDN can also act as a Transparent Proxy.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="95-how-do-you-access-splunk-web-interface-by-default-unless-specified">95. How do you access Splunk Web Interface by default unless specified?</h3>
<p>Splunk Web Interface runs on port 8000 by default. It can be accessed by going to http://localhost:8000</p>

<h3 id="96-can-you-suggest-an-effective-solution-for-encrypting-data-in-rest">96. Can you suggest an effective solution for encrypting data-in-rest?</h3>
<p>I suggest investing in SEDs. SEDs are <strong>Self-Encrypting Drives</strong>, they provide hardware based security by continously scrambling data using a key and descrambles the data while being retrieved with the key.</p>

<h3 id="97-assume-a-pki-scenario-you-have-a-public-and-a-private-key-and-you-often-perform-both-encryption-and-signing-functions-which-key-is-used-for-which-function">97. Assume a PKI Scenario, You have a public and a private key, and you often perform both encryption and signing functions. Which key is used for which function?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>To perform <strong>Signing</strong> and send a message to the recipient, You use your <strong>private key</strong> to sign and send the message. The recipient will use your <strong>public key</strong> to verify whether the message is originally from you.</li>
  <li>To perform <strong>Encryption</strong> and send a message to the recipient, You use the recipient’s <strong>public key</strong> to encrypt the message and the recipient will use their <strong>private key</strong> to decrypt the message.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="98-how-meterpreter-shell-is-better-than-normal-shell-on-an-exploited-machine">98. How Meterpreter shell is better than normal shell on an exploited machine?</h3>
<p>Meterpreter is more advanced than normal shell as you can run many commands with ease. It is possible to dump hashes, migrate to process, easily send and receive files, take screenshots, access webcam, mouse and more.</p>

<h3 id="99-whats-a-heartbeat-and-a-heartbleed">99. What’s a Heartbeat and a HeartBleed?</h3>
<p>HeartBleed is the vulnerability that exploits a built-in feature of OpenSSL called the HeartBeat. When your browser connects to the website and requests data, the website responds back to your browser and responds with data, this is otherwise called the HeartBeat. In this particular vulnerability, the attacker is able to craft a request in such a manner that the server responds back with data from the server’s memory beyond the total data of the initial request, up to 65,536 bytes. These bytes may contain more sensitive information like server config, passwords, etc.</p>

<h3 id="100-you-notice-some-brute-force-attempts-happening-on-your-server-every-five-minutes-as-you-can-infer-this-is-a-near-futile-attempt-can-you-guess-the-motive-behind-this-attacker">100. You notice some brute-force attempts happening on your server every five minutes, as you can infer this is a near futile attempt can you guess the motive behind this attacker?</h3>
<p>The attacker is pretty smart, as he is playing in a defensive way by not triggering the lockout mechanisms. The other crucial part here is the attacker is not just brute forcing your system, there are chances that the attacker is brute-forcing multiple targets and that’s the reason for the idle time. The inference we assume from this scenario is the attacker’s main motive is to build an ultimate botnet.</p>

<h3 id="101-how-will-you-find-your-internal-ip-address-on-your-office-network-when-your-command-prompt-access-is-disabled">101. How will you find your internal IP address on your office network when your command prompt access is disabled?</h3>
<p>Go to Control Panel -&gt; Network &amp; Sharing Center -&gt; Local Area Connection -&gt; Details…</p>

<h3 id="102-what-is-malware-and-spyware-which-is-more-of-a-threat">102. What is Malware and Spyware. Which is more of a threat?</h3>
<p>More of a threat? actually this is a brain teaser question, Malware is nothing but “Malicious Software”, a software that tends to do malicious activities is termed as Malicious Software or Malware. Spyware (spies on your browsing activities, webcam, etc), Adware (annoying popup ads that redirects to some phishing sites) , Ransomware (Wannacry, sites that demand money to remove viruses) etc are grouped under Malware.</p>

<h3 id="103-how-do-you-differentiate-hotfix-patch-and-service-pack">103. How do you differentiate HotFix, Patch and Service Pack?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Hotfix: Say for instance, a few major clients are using a particular version of a software from a vendor and they feel that a particular important feature need is required and they can’t wait for the next version of the product. In that case, the vendor releases a hotfix which is a add-on feature to that particular product. Make a note that this feature is not rolled out public.</li>
  <li>Patch: Unlike hotfixes, the patches are rolled out public. A classic example would be WannaCry Patch.</li>
  <li>Service Pack: This is a bundle that is inclusive of Hotfixes and Patches.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="104-explain-the-four-way-handshake-on-wireless-protocols">104. Explain the four-way handshake on Wireless Protocols.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Access Point sends a ANonce (Nonce is a number used only once) to the Client. (Basically a random integer)</li>
  <li>Client uses the ANonce and PMK (Pairwise Master Key) (The PMK is generated from PSK) to construct the PTK (Pairwise Transient Key). The Client then sends the PTK, Client’s SNonce and MIC to the Access Point.</li>
  <li>The Access Point sends GTK (Group Temporal Key) (The GTK is mostly derived from Group Master Key (GMK) which inturn is derived from Authenticator) and MIC.</li>
  <li>The Client sends the ACK along with MIC.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="105-whats-the-difference-between-xss-and-csrf-attacks">105. What’s the difference between XSS and CSRF attacks?</h3>
<p>Both are client-side attacks, XSS can be more devastating as you can embed executable arbitrary code but with CSRF this is not possible. To exploit a CSRF attack in a website, the attacker has to somehow forge a deceptive link and send it to the victim, the attack will take place only when the user clicks the link, In real world scenario this is pretty hard to carry out. However, in an XSS attack (in this case say a stored XSS vulnerability), the attacker simply has to inject a malicious script (say a cookie stealing script or redirection script) so any victim connects to that particular page will be affected.</p>

<h3 id="106-is-it-possible-to-leverage-a-csrf-attack-using-an-xss-attack">106. Is it possible to leverage a CSRF attack using an XSS attack?</h3>
<p>Yes it is possible. Assume there are two websites Site A (a social networking site) and Site B (a banking application). The victim logs into Site B with credentials and after a while the user navigates to the Site A which has XSS payload that loads stuff in the background and exploits the CSRF vulnerability on Site A. So in this scenario, the attacker did not send any active link to the victim to exploit the CSRF vulnerability on Site B.</p>

<h3 id="107-whats-a-greybox-approach-in-pentesting-is-it-better-than-blackbox">107. What’s a GreyBox approach in Pentesting, Is it better than BlackBox?</h3>
<p>The pentester is provided with <em>not so much</em> information about the target. However, that information provided is quite essential. Some of these information include network diagrams, services, credentials, etc but the target owner may not disclose business critical information during a grey-box test to the pentester. Greybox is obviously better than Blackbox testing as this can be justified with a compact example. Let us assume a login panel that does not have a signup panel, in this case chances are quite faint to explore the internal dashboard and detect the vulnerabilities within. Well in this case, the greybox testing gets an upper hand over the blackbox testing.</p>

<h3 id="108-whats-a-virus-worm-and-a-trojan-horse-are-they-all-same">108. What’s a Virus, Worm and a Trojan Horse? Are they all same?</h3>
<p>Virus, Worm and Trojan falls under the Malware set, but they are not the same. Virus cannot cause damage unless it is invoked by user. Mostly it comes in the form of an executable and it can attach itself to another executable, but does not execute automatically without human intervention. This is not in the case of a Worm, they are a subset of Virus but they have the tendency to attach themselves to other files and can make copies of themselves. Worms can automatically infect a machine without user intervention. A simple example for a worm scenario would be automatically sending a message to all of your contacts in your address book. Trojans are quite different and they are not meant to cause immediate havoc but their effects can be very devastating. Attackers make use of Trojan to place a backdoor in the exploited machine such that they can access the machine anytime or can also make the exploited machine act as a Bot in launching a DoS attack. Trojans give attackers full access over the machine and they behave as a command center. Trojans like Sub7 lets attacker to change the remote computer’s windows settings, turn display upside down, open/close the DVD Drive, etc.</p>

<h3 id="109-whats-a-forward-proxy-and-a-reverse-proxy">109. What’s a Forward proxy and a Reverse proxy?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A Forward proxy sits between the client and the server. Configuration has to be done on the client side. The requests from the client are routed through the proxy and then reaches the server. For better understanding a few examples can be listed out. Say a user in Sweden wants to connect to a website that is accessible only for US residents, the user can make use of a Tor client and change the location to US and then access the particular website. In this case, the ToR client acts a Forward Proxy. Another example would be, An organization may allow access to their application through their specified proxy and port, this restricts outside users to connect to the website unless they knew the proxy address and port.</li>
  <li>A Reverse proxy is quite different. Configuration has to be done on the server side. Load Balancing is one of the concepts that comes under Reverse proxies. A high traffic website make uses of CDNs (Content Delivery Network) to balance the load on their servers; for example certain images, css, javascript files etc are loaded from third party sites.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="110-explain-buffer-overflow-attack-in-a-simple-way-how-to-prevent-it">110. Explain Buffer Overflow Attack in a simple way. How to prevent it?</h3>
<p>Improper and insecure coding practices leads to Buffer Overflow Attacks. By ensuring proper coding standards and secure code development the buffer overflow attacks can be totally mitigated. Buffer overflow involves lots of details but the summary of it can be easily understood with the help of an example. Consider a mobile phone number field in an application which is usually 10 characters of length, if an attacker sends 50 characters to that application, the application abruptly crashes by throwing excess data in the CPU memory. By using certain techniques if the attacker can able to predict where the buffer data is getting overwritten, the attacker will be able to execute arbitary code in the memory, else the program will result in a Denial of Service condition.</p>
